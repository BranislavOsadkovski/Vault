# Vault API
 
Vault API compresses the input data bytes after that creates RSA encryption keys for that data to be encrypted, compressed encrypted data is stored in a Controll Block data structure that holds the data, the private key used for encryption and a hash for the next control block. After that is then encrypted and Signed with XML signature, which is then used to create a hash for the next control block to be encrypted and so creating a blockchain type structure.
 
# Java-Cryptography
Cryptography is the art and science of making a cryptosystem that is capable of providing information security.

Cryptography deals with the actual securing of digital data. It refers to the design of mechanisms based on mathematical algorithms that provide fundamental information 
security services. You can think of cryptography as the establishment of a large toolkit containing different techniques in security applications.

The art and science of breaking the cipher text is known as cryptanalysis.

Cryptanalysis is the sister branch of cryptography and they both co-exist. The cryptographic process results in the cipher text for transmission or storage. 
It involves the study of cryptographic mechanism with the intention to break them. Cryptanalysis is also used during the design of the new cryptographic techniques 
to test their security strengths.
